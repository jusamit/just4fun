UAF

SF Caching option - Relationship of CSR, Plan Sponsor, Groups at per user session.

Scenarios - Data coming through APIs may have additional filtering requirements

Read - 

Update - 

Record/Field leavel restrictions -

Record Level - Based on Plan Sponsor, the filtering can be done
	Complexity - One member id assoicated with multiple PSU id. (Cumb id)
	Need membership id for filtering.


Field Level - Complex

•	What is AH approach to address this earlier communicated requirement – All contextual data that is associated with a thread on creation should be returned when retrieving the thread via Read Threads API.
•	Is salesforce scope covered in your proposal for data model and relevant workflow updates for storing new contextual data ( GPS and Clinical end) ?

Salesforc API Standardization

1. Interface Catalog - Do not exist
2. Only Secure Messaging API is the only place where SF is a provider
	a. Some of the SM APIs can be invoked with SOQL queries; contract may or may not adhere to DIM specifications.
	b. If there are multiple workflows behind the custom API, no single standard contract defined as of today.


NFRs - SA to finalize.

1. Get transaction volumes or extrapolate
2. Evaluate end-to-end response time
3. Confirm with Business, get agreement and communicate to Integration team
4. Communicate Performance Team via QB request during testing
5. Feedback loop from performance/business for final volumes.



Existing Standards - Confirm with IA Domain (e.g. Jivan)

Master - Golden Copy
Path1 - Prod
Path2 - Dev
Path3 - Support

DEV/QA are per path
Stress, UAT(?), Prod are unique

Clinical - Prod code update

DP Options for Token Management 
1 - Input Request from AH provides SF Access Token
2 - xTremeScale Cache to get SF Access Token
3 - IIB Token Mgmt Service 
4 - SF Token Mgmt Service + Cache


OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Token Flow
This flow uses a certificate to sign the JWT request and doesn’t require explicit user interaction --> Access Token

With the OAuth 2.0 JWT bearer token flow, the client posts a JWT to the Salesforce OAuth token endpoint. Salesforce processes the JWT, which includes a digital signature, and issues an access token based on prior approval of the app.

DP (impersonating AH) will need to be set up as a 'Connected App' in Salesforce.
